# astar
A simple A* implementation done on a basic gridworld in python.

###
I did this as practice for the A* algorithm I implemented for my jigsaw puzzle solving project (the one called puzzle on my page). 
I'd never done a pathfinding/decision search algorithm so I wanted to do this to get the basic idea.
Astar1 is my naive approach to get the ideas down, the second is the faster one using a priority queue.
The version in there now creates a dense grid and fills it up with a few random walls every time and starts solving with the faster one.
CV2 used for drawing/displaying the grid and solver.
Really optimizing anything but the solver wasnty really a priority, so the rendering of the world is actually way slower (like 10x or more) than
the solve itself.

if u use this code i need ur first born and a blood sacrifice. >:)
